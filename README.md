# Computer Vision RPS
--trained a model :on Go to Teachable-Machine  to start creating the model. Each class is trained with images of yourself showing each option to the camera. The "Nothing" class represents the lack of option in the image. Remember that the more images you train with, the more accurate the model will be 
Make sure you push the model and labels to your GitHub repository after committing.
--explian what you did when you trained the model :from the "Tensorflow" tab in Teachable-Machine. The model should be named keras_model.h5 and the text file containing the labels should be named labels.txt.
The files you are downloading contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model. They are not files that can be run, and they do not contain anything readable if you look inside. 
Later, you will load them into your Python application in the next milestone.<how you went about it>
--created a githiub repo so i can track my work throuhgout the project <name of repo>
-- published the changes to github
